# Material Dashboard React - Blank Project

This project is based on [Material Dashboard React](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/material-dashboard-react).

## Aims

Material Dashboard React is a fantastic User Interface for representing data in graphs, tables, forms and so on. It allows developers to focus on the retrieval of that data and just plugging it into an already great UI.

This project has been created in an effort to introduce TypeScript and refine some of the components included with MUI. That's why this project has been started! To see if it is possible to convert this great ReactJS Dashboard to use TypeScript, while still being highly functional!

It is an ongoing project, with contributions being made whenever time allows for it.
